The data for the project consists of chapter plot summaries of all the chapters in the 7 Harry Potter books. The plot summaries are from [*harrypotter.fandom.com*](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page). We also got a character overview from [*hp-api.herokuapp.com/*](*https://hp-api.herokuapp.com/*). 

The books consist of 198 chapters and the plot summaries of these totals 57382 words.

The character overview contains information on 403 characters, but only 183 of these are actually mentioned in the plot summaries.

<h1>Motivation</h1>
<div class="line"></div>

This website is an exam project for the course 02467 Computational 
Social Science at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) Spring 2022 Semester. 
The project has been developed using tools, theory, and techniques taught in this course. <br/>
<br/>
The methods used for the analysis presented on this website, are primarily focused on combining Natural Language Processing and Network Science.
Both NLP and Network Science has been applied to examine developments in the dataset. 

<h1>Idea</h1>
<div class="line"></div>

The goal of this project is to explore the world of Harry Potter through the chapter plot summaries available at [*harrypotter.fandom.com*](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page). We wish to examine the development in the seven books, specifically by using social networks to look at characters and using text analysis tools to look at topics and themes.

We are 3 student studying Artificial Intelligence and Data at DTU. We love Harry Potter and decided this was a project we could go at with a decent amount of domain knowledge. We hope you enjoy our findings.

This website is the final assignment in the course 02467 Computational 
Social Science at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) Spring 2022 Semester. 
<br/>

All three team members are hard-core Harry Potter fans. We therefore saw this as the perfect opportunity to put all of our Harry Potter fun facts to use. Our main dataset consists of Harry Potter book summaries at chapter-level. 
Furthermore, we have used a dataset that contain character information to make it easy to identify characters in the summaries. 
We chose our main dataset based on the fact that we wanted to look at the Harry Potter books, which are much more extensive compared to the movies, 
but were not able to use the books directly due to copyrights. Fandom (previously known as Wikia) is a service that hosts wikis mainly on entertainment (i.e. books, movies, and tv shows). 
Thus, it's basically the wikipedia for entertainment and top-quality. This is the reason why we webcapped summaries from there.

Our mission is to do a deep dive into the realm of Harry Potter and examine the development in the seven books. 
Firstly, use social networks to look at characters. We will have a look at which characters play the most essential roles, 
which are connected, and what do they have in common if we partition them? Secondly, use text analysis tools to look at topics and themes. 
We will have a look at what the most important topics are. Furthermore, we have a theory that the books are become more and more dark, sinister, and gloomy, 
which we can hopefully detect via sentiment analysis. We hope that this will be fun for people who are as passionate about Harry Potter as us.

All three of use study Artificial Intelligence and Data at DTU. We love Harry Potter and decided this was a topic we could apply a decent amount of domain knowledge too.

We hope you enjoy the world of Harry Potter data analysis.

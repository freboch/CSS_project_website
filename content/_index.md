# Harry Potter and the Networks of Analysis

This website is an exam project for the course 02467 Computational Social Science at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) Spring 2022 Semester. 

## Idea

The goal of this project is to explore the world of Harry Potter through the chapter plot summaries available at [*harrypotter.fandom.com*](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page). We wish to examine the development in the seven books, specifically by using social networks to look at characters and using text analysis tools to look at topics and themes. 

## Findings



## The team

We are 3 student studying Artificial Intelligence and Data at DTU. We love Harry Potter and decided this was a project we could go at with a decent amount of domain knowledge. We hope you enjoy our findings.
